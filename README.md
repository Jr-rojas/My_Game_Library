## Introduction:
This project is a full-stack website that allows users to view and add games to their library. The website allows users to add and view games as well as developers. When adding a game, users can select from a list of developers that have been added to the database to link it with the game. The website has a simple navigation system that allows users to access the games page, add games, view developers, and add developers. Users can also view game details, which are obtained from the database and displayed on the website.



## Features:

**View Games**: The website allows users to view all the games in their library. The games are displayed in a grid of images.

**Game Details**: When users click on a game from the games grid, they are taken to a page that displays details about the game. The details are obtained from the database and displayed on the website.

**Add Games**: Users can add games to their library using the 'Add Game' form. The form asks for details such as the game title, release date, developer,release date, and a brief description.

**View Developers**: Users can view a list of developers that have been added to the database. Users can view developers and games associated to them.
